# HL2DM-HighScoreResetter
A stupid plugin that prevents someone from having higher points than everyone else

## Commands:
* SR_MaxFrags (Max allowed frags above all players before their score is automatically reset.)
* SR_Announce (If on 1 tells everyone on the server when a player's score reset, if off only informs the attacker.)
